\usage{
est_sve(
  x0,
  x1,
  n0,
  n1,
  level = 0.95,
  method = c("profile", "tanh-wald", "wald", "exact"),

\arguments{
\item{x0}{Numeric. Number of events in the unvaccinated group.}

\item{x1}{Numeric. Number of events in the vaccinated group.}

\item{n0}{Integer. Sample size of the unvaccinated group.}

\item{n1}{Integer. Sample size of the vaccinated group.}

\item{level}{Numeric. Confidence level for the interval (default is 0.95).}

\item{method}{Character. Method used to construct the confidence interval.

One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"profile"} (default): Profile likelihood confidence interval using likelihood
ratio test inversion. More accurate than Wald-based methods, especially
for small samples or extreme efficacy values.
\item \code{"tanh-wald"}: Applies a hyperbolic arctangent
transform before forming the Wald interval, then transforms back.
Keeps the interval bounded in (-1,1).
\item \code{"wald"}: Standard Wald interval on the untransformed scale.
\item \code{"exact"}: Uses exact conditional inference by conditioning on total
cases and inverting the conditional binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson
limits for the conditional parameter). Conservative due to discreteness,
but reliable for small samples or boundary cases.
}}

\item{correction}{Logical. Whether to perform a bias correction, default: \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{estimate}{The symmetric vaccine efficacy estimate.}
\item{lower}{Lower bound of the confidence interval.}
\item{upper}{Upper bound of the confidence interval.}
\item{level}{Confidence interval level.}
\item{method}{Indicates the method used.}
}

\description{
Computes the symmetric vaccine efficacy (SVE) and associated confidence
intervals based on observed proportions of events in vaccinated and
unvaccinated groups.
}
\details{
By default, confidence intervals are constructed using the profile likelihood.
Two Wald-based intervals are available, one that uses the hyperbolic
arctangent (tanh-Wald) to keep the bounds within (-1, 1), and the
original-scale Wald. An exact method based on the Clopper-Pearson intervals
is also available.

The symmetric vaccine efficacy (SVE) is defined as:
\deqn{
\text{SVE} = 2 \times \frac{p_0 - p_1}{p_0 + p_1 + |p_0 - p_1|}
}

The profile likelihood method constructs confidence intervals by inverting
the likelihood ratio test. For a given SVE value, it finds the maximum
likelihood estimates of p0 and p1 subject to the constraint that their
SVE equals the specified value, then compares this constrained likelihood
to the unconstrained MLE.

\examples{
# Example: unvaccinated 10\% infection rate, vaccinated 5\%, equal group sizes

# Profile likelihood method
est_sve(x0 = 10, x1 = 5, n0 = 100, n1 = 100, method = "profile")

# Wald (tanh-Wald)
est_sve(x0 = 100, x1 = 50, n0 = 1000, n1 = 1000, method = "tanh-wald")

# Without transform (uses Wald interval)
est_sve(x0 = 100, x1 = 50, n0 = 1000, n1 = 1000, method = "wald")

# Exact method for small samples
est_sve(x0 = 10, x1 = 5, n0 = 100, n1 = 100, method = "exact")
