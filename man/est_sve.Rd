\title{Symmetric Vaccine Efficacy}
\usage{
est_sve(x0, x1, n0, n1, level = 0.95, method = c("tanh-wald", "wald", "exact"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x0}{Numeric. Number of events in the unvaccinated group.}

\item{x1}{Numeric. Number of events in the vaccinated group.}

\item{n0}{Integer. Sample size of the unvaccinated group.}

\item{n1}{Integer. Sample size of the vaccinated group.}

\item{level}{Confidence level for the interval (default is 0.95).}

\item{method}{Method used to construct the confidence interval.

One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"tanh-wald"} (default): Applies a hyperbolic arctangent
transform before forming the Wald interval, then transforms back.
Improves coverage when the estimate is near +/- 1.
\item \code{"wald"}: Standard Wald interval on the untransformed scale.
\item \code{"exact"}: Uses exact conditional inference by conditioning on total
cases and inverting the conditional binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson
limits for the conditional parameter). Conservative due to discreteness,
but reliable for small samples or boundary cases.

\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{estimate}{The symmetric vaccine efficacy estimate.}
\item{lower}{Lower bound of the confidence interval.}
\item{upper}{Upper bound of the confidence interval.}
\item{level}{Confidence interval level.}
\item{method}{Indicates the method used: "tanh-Wald", "Wald", or "Exact".}
}
}
\description{
Computes the \strong{symmetric vaccine efficacy (SVE)} and associated confidence
intervals based on observed proportions of events in vaccinated and
unvaccinated groups.
}
\details{
By default, confidence intervals are constructed using the hyperbolic
arctangent (tanh-Wald) for improved coverage, especially when efficacy values
approach the bounds of +/- 1. An exact method based on the Clopper-Pearson
intervals is also available for small samples or boundary cases.

The symmetric vaccine efficacy (SVE) is defined as:
\deqn{
\text{SVE} = 2 \times \frac{p_0 - p_1}{p_0 + p_1 + |p_0 - p_1|}
}
}
\examples{
# Example: unvaccinated 10\% infection rate, vaccinated 5\%, equal group sizes
est_sve(x0 = 100, x1 = 50, n0 = 1000, n1 = 1000, method = "tanh-wald")

# Without Fisher z-transform (uses Wald interval)
est_sve(x0 = 100, x1 = 50, n0 = 1000, n1 = 1000, method = "wald")

# Exact method for small samples
est_sve(x0 = 10, x1 = 5, n0 = 100, n1 = 100, method = "exact")
